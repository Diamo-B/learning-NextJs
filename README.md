# learning-NextJs
This is a Repo where i'm gonna follow a full NextJS tutorial in the net ninja's youtube channel as a next step after the react course, where i'm gonna be making a simple webapp just to familiarise myself with the NextJs world in order to start my first fullStack app using Javascript-based frameworks if I can call them so. Happy Coding:grin:

<strong>Next.js</strong> is an open-source web development framework created by Vercel enabling React-based web applications with server-side rendering and generating static websites. React documentation mentions Next.js among "Recommended Toolchains" advising it to developers as a solution when "Building a server-rendered website with Node.js".Where traditional React apps can only render their content in the client-side browser, <strong>Next.js</strong> extends this functionality to include applications rendered on the server-side.
